<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>OpsDB (Operations Database) is an internal automation/management tool used by Wish. It performs many functions for automating and scaling internal processes for infrastructure. Also, it tracks internal infrastructure information such as machines/servers, ip addresses, IT info, etc. The backend of OpsDB is coded in Golang and the data/schema is stored in Postgres (9.6+). The frontend is built on a Limitless Web Application Kit template (HTML/JS/CSS) compatible with Bootstrap 3. The majority of dynamic UI generation is done on the server from the data stored in OpsDB. An custom built language called UDN (Universal Dotted Language - pronounced yudien) is used to communicate between the backend/frontend and transfers/sets/collects data from various endpoints.</p>
